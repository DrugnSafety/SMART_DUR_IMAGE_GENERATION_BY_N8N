# SMART DUR Patient-Customized Medication Guidance Image Generation Workflow

## Overview
An automated n8n workflow system that generates **patient-customized medication guidance images** for the SMART DUR (Smart Drug Utilization Review) platform. This system goes beyond generic medication instructions by creating personalized visual guidance based on each patient's specific characteristics, current medications, diagnosed conditions, and adverse drug reaction history.

## System Purpose & Value

### Why Patient-Customized Guidance?
Traditional medication guidance provides the same information to all patients, regardless of their individual risk factors. This system addresses this limitation by:

1. **Personalized Risk Assessment**: Analyzes each patient's specific risk factors (age, gender, current medications, medical history)
2. **Targeted Warning Generation**: Identifies which patients are at higher risk for specific adverse drug reactions
3. **Visual Communication**: Creates easy-to-understand illustrations that help elderly patients comprehend complex medical information
4. **Preventive Care**: Proactively warns about potential side effects before they occur

### Target Users
- **Healthcare Providers**: Pharmacists, doctors, nurses who provide medication counseling
- **Patients**: Especially elderly patients who may have difficulty understanding text-only instructions
- **Caregivers**: Family members responsible for medication management

## Complete Workflow Overview

### 1. Data Source & Upload
- **Source**: "나의건강기록" (My Health Record) system
- **Process**: Healthcare providers download patient health records and upload to MyADR platform
- **Data Types**: 
  - Current medication list
  - Diagnosed disease list
  - Adverse drug reaction history
  - Patient demographics (age, gender)

### 2. Data Analysis & Risk Assessment
- **MyADR Platform**: Analyzes uploaded patient data using drug safety algorithms
- **DUR Analysis**: Identifies potential drug-drug interactions, contraindications, and high-risk scenarios
- **Risk Scoring**: Determines which patients need customized guidance based on risk factors

### 3. Customized Guidance Generation
- **Text Generation**: Creates patient-specific medication guidance text (복약지도문)
- **Risk Prioritization**: Focuses on the most critical warnings for each patient
- **Language Adaptation**: Uses simple, clear Korean language suitable for elderly patients

### 4. Visual Image Creation (This Workflow)
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Uses OpenAI's DALL-E to create custom medical illustrations
- **Patient-Specific Content**: Incorporates patient age, gender, specific medications, and risk factors
- **Visual Risk Communication**: Shows symptoms to watch for, medications involved, and recommended actions

### 5. Delivery to Patients
- **Dual Format**: Provides both text guidance and visual illustration
- **Enhanced Understanding**: Visual aids help patients better comprehend medication risks
- **Actionable Information**: Clear guidance on what symptoms to watch for and when to seek medical help

## Detailed Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Data Input & Monitoring
```
MyADR Platform → Google Sheets → n8n Trigger
```

**Input Data Structure (Sheet1):**
- **연구자등록번호**: Unique patient/researcher identifier (e.g., `cbnuh_0001`)
- **SMART_DUR_생성일**: When the DUR analysis was performed
- **구분자**: Unique identifier combining patient ID and timestamp
- **age/gender**: Patient demographics (e.g., 70-year-old female)
- **SMART_DUR_json**: Detailed JSON containing medication safety analysis
- **복약지도문_원문**: Original medication guidance text
- **is_finished**: Processing status flag

**Example Input Data:**
![Input Data Sample](input_data_sample.jpg)

```json
{
  "identifier": "DUR_0001",
  "objects": {
    "object_A": {
      "name": "델미원정80밀리그램(텔미사르탄)",
      "code": "C09CA07"
    },
    "object_B": {
      "name": "고령자",
      "code": "AGE001"
    }
  },
  "target_outcome": {
    "fsn": "고령자에서 텔미사르탄에 의한 과도한 혈압강하",
    "severity": "Moderate",
    "watchful_symptoms": ["어지럼증", "실신", "무기력증"]
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Data Processing & Analysis
```
JSON Parsing → Risk Assessment → Patient-Specific Analysis
```

**Processing Logic:**
1. **Multiple Identifiers**: Each patient may have multiple DUR alerts
2. **Multiple Outcomes**: Each alert may have multiple target outcomes
3. **Risk Prioritization**: System processes each combination individually
4. **Patient Context**: Incorporates age, gender, and specific medication details

**Example Processing:**
- Patient: 70-year-old female
- Alert 1: Telmisartan + Elderly patient → Risk of excessive blood pressure drop
- Alert 2: Metformin duplication → Risk of hypoglycemia

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Image Generation
```
Prompt Engineering → DALL-E Generation → Quality Assurance
```

**Prompt Generation (GPT-5):**
The system creates detailed, structured prompts that ensure consistent medical illustration style:

```
"Simple, schematic single-panel cartoon-style medical illustration.
Flat vector style, soft pastel colors, thick clean outlines, minimal shading, clean white background.
Depict a 70-year-old female patient at the center.
Show Telmisartan as the clear cause of the problem, drawn as simple and recognizable icons.
Around the patient, display small icons or speech bubbles representing watchful symptoms: dizziness, fainting, lethargy.
Facial expression and body language should match the symptoms.
At the bottom, include a small signboard with the recommendation: 'Be careful of hypotension symptoms when administering Telmisartan to elderly patients.'"
```

**Image Generation (DALL-E):**
- **Style**: Simple, schematic, cartoon-style medical illustrations
- **Format**: 1024x1024 high-quality JPG
- **Content**: Patient-centered with clear symptom indicators and medication information
- **Accessibility**: Designed for elderly patient comprehension

### Phase 4: Storage & Documentation
```
Google Drive Upload → Spreadsheet Update → Completion Tracking
```

**File Organization:**
- **Folder Structure**: `2025_08_DUR_이미지생성/{researcher_id}/`
- **File Naming**: `{researcher_id}_{identifier}_{outcome_index}_{symptom}.jpg`
- **Example**: `cbnuh_0001_DUR_0001_1_과도한혈압강하.jpg`

**Output Data (Sheet2):**
![Output Data Sample](output_data_sample.jpg)

- **Image URLs**: Direct links to generated images
- **Google Sheets Integration**: IMAGE formulas for direct spreadsheet viewing
- **Metadata**: Processing timestamps, file information, and patient context
